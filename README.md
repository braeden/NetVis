##What is a Data Visualization?

A data visualization is a graphic that uses the physical dimensions (position, area, color, etc…) of the graphic’s space to represent a set of data so that the data can be observed visually in order to gain insight. Visualizations might also change over time or when a user interacts with them.

Sometimes a visualization is meant to elucidate a previously known characteristic of the data that is difficult to convey to an audience. Creating a visualization can tell a story. At other times a visualization is created in order to explore a set of data and uncover unknown patterns in that data. Creating a visualization can help to better understand complexity. The following website contains a non-exhaustive lists of possible visualizations: Visualization Types.
